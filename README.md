# Description

This repository contains two machine learning projects completed during my internship at TECH-A-INTERN. The projects focus on:

## Iris Classification: 
A classic machine learning task involving the classification of iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## TCS Stock Price Prediction: 
Using historical stock price data of TCS (Tata Consultancy Services), the goal is to predict future stock prices using machine learning techniques.

### Project Details

#### Iris Classification
###### Objective: 
To classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
##### Dataset: 
The famous Iris dataset, which is often used for educational purposes and benchmarking algorithms.
##### Approach: 
Employed various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for classification.
##### Evaluation: 
Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### TCS Stock Price Prediction
##### Objective: 
To predict the future stock price of TCS based on historical stock price data and potentially other relevant features.
##### Dataset: 
Historical stock price data of TCS, which includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume.
##### Approach: 
Utilized time series forecasting techniques, possibly including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or other regression models.
##### Evaluation: 
Model performance was assessed using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and potentially others depending on the specific implementation.

#### Usage

Each project folder contains the necessary code, datasets, and documentation to reproduce the results. Detailed instructions on running the code and any dependencies required are provided within each project's README file.
